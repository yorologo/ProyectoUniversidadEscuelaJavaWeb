Web development with Java

INTRODUCTION
The Java web application is used to create dynamic websites. Java provides support for web applications through Servlets and JSP. We can create a website with static HTML pages, but when we want the information to be dynamic, we need a web application.

EXERCISE
The practice is to make a web page with java that implements a CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete, for its acronym in English). This page should simulate a student and subject control system for a school.

SOLUTION
Since the technology to be used is java, the page consists of a main page in HTML, where you can insert new students and subjects into the school's database, implemented in MariaDB as a database manager; The main page also has access to some web pages created from servlets where they show all the records to students and subjects, stored in the database.
In each of the rows, belonging to each of the records, of the tables that show the information in the database, in the last column on the right side there are some action buttons with which you can make any modification or elimination of the data corresponding to the same row.

CONCLUSION
Web servers are good for static content HTML pages, but they don't know how to generate dynamic content or how to save data in databases, so we need another tool that we can use to generate dynamic content. There are various programming languages ​​for dynamic content like PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, Java Servlets and JSP.
Java Servlet and JSP are server-side technologies to extend the capacity of web servers by providing support for dynamic response and data persistence.
